## IDLE PROTOCOL

**If I find myself idle, I will:**

1. **Check this file first** - What's the next unchecked item?
2. **If P0 items exist** - Work on those
3. **If no P0 items** - Move to P1
4. **If no P1 items** - Move to P2
5. **If blocked on all** - Ask for direction

**Never idle without checking this list.**
